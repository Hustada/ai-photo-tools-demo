### Success Metrics
- Page load time improvement (>50%)
- User engagement increase (>30%)
- AI accuracy improvement (>15%)
- Feature adoption rates (>70% for core features)

## Development Workflow
1. **TDD Approach**: Write tests first for all new features
2. **Documentation**: CodeCraft agent creates blog posts for each feature
3. **Code Review**: Thorough review process for quality assurance
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure impact of each enhancement

## Documentation Strategy
