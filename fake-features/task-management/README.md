â”œâ”€â”€ TaskManager.tsx          # Main management interface
â”œâ”€â”€ TaskBoard.tsx           # Kanban drag-and-drop board
â”œâ”€â”€ TeamCollaboration.tsx   # Team features and notifications
â”œâ”€â”€ TaskStorage.ts          # Data persistence and analytics
â”œâ”€â”€ __tests__/             # Comprehensive test suite

```

### Key Technologies
- **React 18**: Modern hooks-based components with TypeScript
- **HTML5 Drag & Drop API**: Native drag-and-drop functionality
- **localStorage**: Client-side data persistence
- **Performance API**: Accurate timing measurements
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Responsive layout system

## Usage Examples

### Basic Task Creation
```typescript
const newTask: Task = {
  title: "Implement user authentication",
  description: "Add JWT-based login system",
  priority: "high",
  status: "pending",
  dueDate: new Date('2025-02-01'),
  assignedTo: "john.doe",
  tags: ["auth", "backend", "security"],
  estimatedHours: 8
};
```

### Advanced Filtering
```typescript
const filter: TaskFilter = {
  status: ['in-progress', 'pending'],
  priority: ['high', 'urgent'],
  assignedTo: 'john.doe',
  tags: ['backend'],
  dueDateRange: {
    start: new Date('2025-01-01'),
    end: new Date('2025-01-31')
  }
};
```

### Analytics Integration
```typescript
const metrics = taskStorage.generateMetrics(tasks);
console.log(`Completion Rate: ${metrics.completionRate}%`);
console.log(`Average Completion Time: ${metrics.averageCompletionTime} days`);
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Debounced Filtering**: 300ms debounce on search and filter operations
