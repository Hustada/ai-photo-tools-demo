# CompanyCam AI Photo Inspirations Demo

## Elevating Photo Management with Artificial Intelligence

This application is an ongoing exploration and demonstration of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can potentially enhance the CompanyCam platform. The current focus is on providing intelligent suggestions for photo tags and descriptions, with the broader aim of showcasing practical approaches to AI-driven metadata improvements. The ultimate goals include boosting user efficiency, improving data quality, and unlocking new organizational capabilities for photos within CompanyCam.

## The Challenge: Rich Metadata is Key, But Manual Tagging is Time-Consuming

High-quality tags and descriptive metadata are crucial for organizing, searching, and deriving value from the vast number of photos managed in CompanyCam. However, manually adding comprehensive metadata to each photo can be a significant time investment for users.

## The AI-Powered Solution: Intelligent Suggestions, Seamless Integration

This demo introduces AI-powered features to assist users by:

1.  **Suggesting Relevant Tags:** Leveraging AI to analyze photo content and suggest relevant tags, reducing manual effort and improving tag consistency.
2.  **Generating Descriptive Text:** Offering AI-generated descriptions for photos, providing richer context with minimal user input.
3.  **User-Controlled Enhancements:** Users review AI suggestions and can choose to "accept" them.
4.  **Dedicated AI Metadata Storage:** Accepted AI tags and descriptions are stored in a separate, dedicated backend (using Vercel KV), demonstrating how AI enhancements can be managed even with specific existing API workflows.
5.  **Unified & Clear Display:** CompanyCam's native tags and the accepted AI-generated tags are presented together seamlessly in the UI. AI-originated tags are clearly distinguished visually (e.g., with a different color and an "(AI)" suffix) for transparency.
6.  **Smart Photo Management:** Scout AI intelligently curates photo collections, identifying similar photos and recommending optimal retention strategies.
7.  **Time-Based Lifecycle Management:** Automated retention policies with configurable deletion workflows ensure photo libraries stay organized while preventing accidental data loss.

## Setup & Running the Demo

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   `pnpm` (or `npm`/`yarn`)
*   A CompanyCam API Key
*   Vercel account with KV store set up (for persisting AI enhancements)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file (or `.env` if preferred by your setup) in the root of the project with the following variables:

```env
# CompanyCam API Key (User will provide this via the Login UI)
# No specific variable needed here as it's entered in the app.

# Vercel KV Store (for /api/ai-enhancements)
KV_URL=your_vercel_kv_store_url
KV_REST_API_URL=your_vercel_kv_store_rest_api_url
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_vercel_kv_store_api_token
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=your_vercel_kv_store_read_only_api_token

# Optional: API Key for the AI suggestion service (e.g., OpenAI)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# (This would be used by the /api/suggest-ai-tags backend if fully implemented)
```

**Note:** The CompanyCam API key is entered by the user in the application's login screen and stored in `localStorage`. The Vercel KV variables are needed for the backend API route that saves accepted AI tags and descriptions.
