# Development Session Summary - July 6, 2025

## Current Status
We successfully implemented **automatic best photo selection for burst sequences** using Claude Vision API with quality assessment. The feature is complete and working.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Best Photo Selection for Burst Sequences âœ…
- **Enhanced Claude Vision API** (`/api/claude-visual-analysis.ts`)
  - Added `PhotoQualityMetrics` interface with detailed quality scores
  - Updated Claude's prompt to assess photo quality (sharpness, composition, lighting, subject clarity)
  - Implemented quality-based selection algorithm that ranks photos by quality score
  - Added fallback quality assessment for when Claude Vision fails

- **Updated Data Structures** 
  - Added `qualityMetrics` to `AnalysisResult` interface
  - Added `bestPhotoId` and `qualityRanking` to `DuplicateGroup` interface
  - Quality scores range from 0-1 (displayed as 0-100%)

- **Enhanced UI Display** (`/src/pages/DuplicateAnalysisPage.tsx`)
  - Crown icon (ðŸ‘‘) marks the best quality photo in burst sequences
  - Quality percentage overlays on photos
  - Ranking numbers (1, 2, 3...) for quality order
  - Best photo highlighted with green ring
  - Detailed quality breakdown in photo detail modal

### 2. Fixed CodeCraft Session Management âœ…
- **Issue**: CodeCraft was incorrectly cleaning up sessions when API calls failed
- **Fix**: Modified `scripts/blog-complete.ts` to only complete sessions on successful blog generation
- **Result**: Sessions now stay active when API fails, allowing retry after fixing issues

## Current Issue: Environment Variable Override

### Problem
- Gemini API key works fine manually: `AIzaSyD0SxOMgNZqReInejSb_QhX_zIAz4WaTFU`
- Shell environment has stuck variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`
- This overrides the .env file setting, causing CodeCraft to fail

### Solution Required
1. **Restart terminal completely** to clear all environment variables
2. Check shell profile files (`.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`) for stuck variables
3. Environment should then read from .env file: `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD0SxOMgNZqReInejSb_QhX_zIAz4WaTFU`

### Current Configuration (should work after terminal restart)
```bash
# .env file settings
AI_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD0SxOMgNZqReInejSb_QhX_zIAz4WaTFU
```

## Next Steps After Terminal Restart

1. **Verify Environment**:
   ```bash
   echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Should be empty or show correct key
   ```

2. **Test CodeCraft**:
   ```bash
   npm run docs:complete  # Should work with Gemini 2.5 Pro
   ```

3. **If Still Issues**: Check shell profile files for persistent environment variables

## Technical Achievement Summary

### Best Photo Selection Feature
- **Automatic Quality Assessment**: Claude Vision now evaluates each photo's quality
- **Smart Selection**: Automatically identifies the best photo from burst sequences
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear UI showing which photos are recommended
- **Detailed Metrics**: Breakdown of sharpness, composition, lighting, and clarity scores
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Specific advice like "Keep photo abc123... - highest quality (95%)"

### Files Modified
- `api/claude-visual-analysis.ts` - Added quality assessment and selection algorithm
- `src/pages/DuplicateAnalysisPage.tsx` - Enhanced UI with quality indicators
- `scripts/blog-complete.ts` - Fixed session management on API failures

## Git Status
- **Branch**: `feat/refine-image-analysis`
- **Latest Commit**: `934a205` - "fix: Keep CodeCraft session active when API generation fails"
- **Status**: All changes committed and pushed

## Ready to Resume
After restarting terminal, the burst sequence quality selection feature is complete and CodeCraft should work properly with Gemini 2.5 Pro for documentation generation.
